4.  Installation
========================================================

To install the SRP Player, please follow the procedures described below. You cannot run the SRP Player directly from this installation disk.


--------------------
- Installing the program from CD-ROM
Follow the instructions on the setup menu on the CD-ROM to install and set up.


========================================================
5.  Important Notes
========================================================

- If you're using a rotary axis unit, the loadable workpiece size is narrower than the cutting area. This is because the area is limited to help prevent possible interference between the spindle and the rotary axis unit.

- The cutting area along the X axis when using the ZCL-40 is 48.8 millimeters. (In the Y and Z directions, the limitation is to a diameter of 85 millimeters or less, which is the loadable workpiece size for the ZCL-40.) This is the area that can be cut without the spindle interfering with the ZCL-40, and cannot be enlarged. Please take note.

- SRP Player cannot import IGES files that are exported by Dr. PICZA version 2.90 or earlier.


========================================================

If you have questions or problems, please contact your local vendor or Roland sales center.
